# Networking_Lab
Networking lab project performed while at Divergence Academy.

Worked in a five-man team to create an SMB network with a LAN, DMZ, and Guest network. Used a GNS3, a network simulation environment, to deploy services across multiple servers including: a Windows domain controller and DNS environment, an IIS web server, a Windows FTP server, a Win10 workstation, and a LAMP web server running on Ubuntu 18.04 hosting a DokuWiki documentation site. Configured and utilized a FortiGate firewall with a VIP for the DMZ web server.
